# OpenShift WildFly Cartridge

These instructions will get you up and running with **WildFly 9.0.0.Alpha1**. To run WildFly 8.1.0.Final instead, take a look at the documentation [here](https://github.com/openshift-cartridges/openshift-wildfly-cartridge/tree/wildfly-8).

This cartridge is based on the JBoss AS cartridge found in OpenShift Origin [here](https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/tree/master/cartridges/openshift-origin-cartridge-jbossas).  

Pretty much everything seems to be working fine, but it can still use some testing.  

If you find any issues, please log them in the [issues](https://github.com/openshift-cartridges/openshift-wildfly-cartridge/issues) section of the [github](https://github.com/openshift-cartridges/openshift-wildfly-cartridge) project.  

This cartridge will act very similarly to the jbossas-7 cartridge that you can create a gear with.  
You should be able to modify the code in the /src directory of the git repository, and do a git add, git commit, and git push and have it deployed as ROOT.war.  
You can also remove the pom.xml and /src directories and place a war file in the deployments directory and they should deploy like they do on JBoss AS 7  

### Create a new WildFly 9 app

The following command can be used to create a new WildFly 9 app using the OpenShift [command line tools](https://www.openshift.com/get-started):

	rhc app create wildfly https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-cartridges/openshift-wildfly-cartridge/wildfly-9/metadata/manifest.yml
	
It will take a few minutes to build, so be patient.

**NOTE:** It will soon be possible to create a WildFly 9 app using the OpenShift Web Console as well. Stay tuned for that.

### JBoss CLI

This cartridge provides an OpenShift compatible wrapper of the JBoss CLI tool on the gear PATH, located at $OPENSHIFT_WILDFLY_DIR/bin/tools/jboss-cli.sh. Use the following command to connect to the WildFly instance with the CLI tool:

        jboss-cli.sh -c --controller=$OPENSHIFT_WILDFLY_IP:$OPENSHIFT_WILDFLY_MANAGEMENT_HTTP_PORT

### Super Secret Hint (Don't tell anyone)

If you run the rhc port-forward command, you can access the WildFly management interface on port 9990.  
A username and password is created when you install this cartridge.  
If you don't write it down, fear not, the following environment variables will contain them.  
$OPENSHIFT_WILDFLY_USERNAME  
$OPENSHIFT_WILDFLY_PASSWORD

	corey$ rhc port-forward wildfly
	Checking available ports ... done
	Forwarding ports ...

	To connect to a service running on OpenShift, use the Local address

	Service Local               OpenShift
	------- -------------- ---- -------------------
	java    127.0.0.1:8080  =>  127.13.118.129:8080
	java    127.0.0.1:9990  =>  127.13.118.129:9990
	java    127.0.0.1:9999  =>  127.13.118.129:9999
	
In this example, you would visit 127.0.0.1:9990 to access the WildFly Admin Console from your local computer.

### Markers

Adding marker files to `.openshift/markers` will have the following effects:

    java8                Will run WildFly with Java 8 if present

    java7                Will run WildFly with Java 7 if present

New WildFly apps will default to using Java 8.
